Langan and Guthrie stole the money while McCarthy carried a fake bomb held in an Easter basket.  Scot Stedeford drove the getaway car.',\n",
       " \"Avishai Raviv, an undercover member of the Israeli Secret Service was assumed responsible for the creation of the right-wing extremist group Eyal. Although Yamir confessed to working alone in the murder, there is evidence that Raviv knew of his intentions to kill Rabin. Raviv was known as an openly violent critic of the Prime Minister's role in the Oslo Accords and the peace process. There is speculation that Yamir was working under the auspices of Eyal, but only his association with the group were confirmed.  There are also allegations that Rabin's aides were informed in June that there would be an assassination, and were informed of many characteristics of the perpetrator.  Little is known as to whether or not Shin Bet actually received this information.  Hagai Amir, the assailants brother, and Dror Adani were also charged with involvement in the murder.\",\n",
       " 'The device was discovered by an employee of the company at about 5:00am. The authorities were questioning and investigating a number of young suspects, who were affiliated with the Animal Defense League and Animal Liberation Front (ALF).  However, it seems the investigation came to a halt, and perpetrators were not identified. This incident is related to the firebombing of the same target three days later, and is believed to have been committed by the same perpetrator(s), since the first incendiary failed to ignite.',\n",
       " 'The bomb detonated at 12:30 AM. Authorities were unsure of the target of the attack.  The abortion clinic had previously been the target of bomb threats, however, the incident took place during tax filing week.',\n",
       " 'The arson was discovered around 5:00am, by the same employee who found the unexploded incendiary a few days earlier (41195). The authorities were questioning and investigating a number of young suspects, who were affiliated with the Animal Defense League and Animal Liberation Front (ALF).  However, it seems the investigation came to a halt, and perpetrators were not identified.',\n",
       " 'The explosions occurred at about 12:36 a.m.',\n",
       " 'Pete Langan and Richard Guthrie entered the bank wearing construction worker uniforms.  Pete Langan stole the money while Richard Guthrie placed the fake bomb on a table and yelled out Spanish phrases.  The date of the incident was specifically chosen to coincide with the date that the remains of the Murrah building in Oklahoma City, the building bombed by Timothy McVeigh, were destroyed.  Langan and Guthrie shared many anti-government beliefs with McVeigh and were even suspected of collaborating with him.',\n",
       " \"The incident occurred at about 2:40am.  After searching Boulter's residence, police found evidence consistent with materials used to start the fire at Majestic meats, as well as cause the vandalism found at the scene. Nine days after the incident, Boutler admitted to a fellow employee that she was responsible for the incident.\",\n",
       " 'The perpetrator, Jacob Kenison, may have also been involved in the Straight Edge Movement and The Coalition To Abolish Fur Trade (CAFT) groups.',\n",
       " 'The next day, Tim Welch and Gary Cox burnt down the Macedonia Baptist Church in Bloomville South Carolina (199506210010).  Though he did not take part in setting the church on fire, fellow Klansman  Haley (AKA Romeo) was found guilty of choosing the target and convincing Welch and Cox to commit the act of arson.',\n",
